# llm-rag-demo
A beginner-friendly demo of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) using Python and Large Language Models.
# LLM Retrieval-Augmented Generation Demo

This repository contains a simple prototype demonstrating how Large Language Models (LLMs)
can be combined with semantic search to answer questions grounded in real documents.

## Key Concepts
- Text preprocessing and chunking
- Embeddings and semantic search
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Python-based backend logic

## Use Cases
- Knowledge base search
- Research assistance
- AI-powered document Q&A

This project is built for learning, experimentation, and hackathon-style rapid prototyping.
